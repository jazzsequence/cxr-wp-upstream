# Chris Reynolds' WordPress (Composer Managed) template

This is an example upstream repository based on Pantheon's [WordPress (Composer Managed)](https://github.com/pantheon-upstreams/wordpress-composer-managed) upstream that works with the Platform's Integrated Composer build process.

Unlike with other Pantheon upstreams, the WordPress core install, which you are unlikely to adjust while building sites, is not in the main branch of the repository. Instead, it is referenced as dependencies within [Roots/Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) that are installed by [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).
